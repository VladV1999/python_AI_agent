This agent will provide you with 4 functions:
1:reading a file, 2:writing to a file (and creating one if it doesn't exist)
3: listing the files in a specified directory, 4: and running a python file
Though I do intend to add more functionality later :D
Simply supply the prompt after running with "uv run main.py <insert prompt here>
Do note that you do have to be in the root directory for this to work!
